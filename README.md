styleGuide
==========

This little project present the style guide of your site. It has been inspired by the excellent article of Anna Debenham : http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/

This style guide concerns only Bootstrap designs as it's the fwk I've decided to use for the next months.

The idea behind this project is to create a tool that UX coders will be able to use dynamically during a project : They put this tool into their project and take the SMACSS approach. 

For every step, they'll se on a dedicated page the result of their work. The layout(s) of the site, the components ...
The philosophy is very close to Unit Testing : You cut your design into testable parts !

You welcome to participate and share.

Let's go to this beautiful Unit Interface Coding tool :)
